/**
 * @note
 * 
 * @create
 * Threads can be created by 5 ways
 * 1) Function call - Eg, thread first and second
 * 2) Lambda call - Eg thread t1
 * 3) Functor (Function object) - Eg thread t2
 * 4) Non static member function - Eg thread t3
 * 5) Static member function - Eg thread t4
 * 
 * @join
 * Once a thread is started, we(Main) wait for it to finish by calling join() on thread object
 * Double join for same thread will result into program termination/crash
 * hence, we need to check thread is joinable or not beforhand using joinable(){
 * if not joinable- join() shoudnt be added for that thread
 * if yes, join it
 * }
 * 
 * @detach
 * used to detach newly created thread from the parent thread(main)
 * let say you no longer want to wait for a thread..so dont join it..instead use t.detach()
 * if main() is returned..detached thread execution is suspended
 * double detach is problematic same like join()..so use the same solution using joinable()
 * if joinable{
 * then only detach()
 * }
 * 
 * @Very IMP_NOTE
 *  ALWAYS try to join or detach the thread you are creating depending on the requirement
 *  if not..it may lead to problem as thread calls its destructors which will terminate the program

/**
 * @RACE CONDITION
 * Race condition occure when two or more threads/processes happens to change a common resource/critical data at same time
 * that critical section needs to be provided 
 * 
 * @MUTEX (Mutual Exclusion - Samjhouta(Hindi))
 * It is used to avoid Race condition
 * Mutex is a locking mechanism
 * Mutex is used to provide synchronization which means only one thread can access the object a time
 * By the use of Mutex keyword we can lock our object from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time.
 * Thread which locks it will only unlock it and noone else
 * Working based on binary value 1/0
 * Initially 1 when initialized..thread locking it will decrement it to 0
 * other threads will till then wait(get blocked) in this lock() call as for them value will be 0
 * once its critical section is done execution...it will unlock it and update 1 again
 * other threads will then take over the control ( 1 at a time)
 * lock(), unlock() - blocking call
 * 
 * std::mutex::try_lock() - non blocking version of lock()
 * Tries to lock the mutex..if not returns immediately without blocking
 * if unsucc lock as in above case..returns false 
 * 
 * if(m.try_lock()){
 *  //if true..it will enter here and execute critical section
 * }
 * 
 * if same threads calls try_lock()...it results is deadlock...(recursive mutex is the solution for you then)
 *
 * 
 * 
 * @lock_guard
 * light weight wraper for owing the mutex on scope basis
 * 
 * 
 * lock_guard<mutex> lock(mtx);
 * no need for unlock as mtx will auto unlock once lock_guard is out of scope
 *  
 */

/**
 * @Condition Variable (Signalling mechanism)
 * A.Notify other threads 
 * B.Waiting for some condition
 * 
 * CV allows running threads to wait on some condition and once those condiitons are met..alert/notify other threads using
 * -cond is the object of condition_variable
 * - cond.wait(mutex)
 * - cond.notify_one()
 * - cond.notify_all()
 * Needs mutex to implement
 * 
 * 
 * DEADLOCK is a condition that occurs when two threads or processes wait for each other to complete and halts without proceeding further.
 * 
 * Necessary condition :
 *  Mutual exclusion
 *  Hold and Wait
 *  No preemption
 *  Circular wait
