/**
 * LegacyRectangle's interface is not compatible with the system that would like to reuse it.
 * An abstract base class is created that specifies the desired interface.
 * An "adapter" class is defined that publicly inherits the interface of the abstract class
 * , and privately inherits the implementation of the legacy component. This adapter class "maps"
 * or "impedance matches" the new interface to the old implementation.
 *
 * Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method expects to receive "x, y, w, h" parameters.
 * But the client wants to pass "upper left x and y" and "lower right x and y". This
 * incongruity can be reconciled by adding an additional level of indirection – i.e.
 * an Adapter object.

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
