/**@TOPIC :: SMART POINTERS (include <memory.h>)
 * @NOTES
 *
 * Smart pointer is a class which wraps a raw pointer so that its lifetime can be managed
 * Its fundamental job is to remove the chances of memory leak
 * it makes sure object is deleted if it is not referenced anymore
 * Crucial to RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization) programming strategy
 * -> main goal is to ensure that resource acquisition occurs at the same time that the object is initialized
 * -> resource for the object is created and made ready in single line of code
 * -> In practical terms, DM is allocated to stack allocated object whose destructor contains the code to delete or free the resource
 *
 * Types discussed below:
 *
 * <NOTE> : auto_ptr depreciated after C++11, unique_ptr came with similar functionality
 *        but with improved security
 *
 * 1) unique_ptr
 * allows only one owner of the underlying pointer
 * ownership can be moved but not copied or shared via move()
 * > copy is not allowed so = won't work
 * > up2 = up1       // No
 * > up2 = move(up1) // Yes ... up1 points to NULL now
 * Use when you want to have single ownership(exclusive) of the resource
 * size = 8 bytes
 *
 * 2) shared_ptr
 * allows multiple owner of same pointer ( Reference count is maintained via use_count() )
 * Use when you want to share ownership of a resource ( assign 1 raw pointer to multiple owners)
 * raw pointer is not deleted until all s_p owners have gone out of scope or have given up their ownerships
 * size = 16 bytes (2 pointer size -> 1 for object and 1 for shared control block that contains ref_count)
 *
 *
 * 3) weak_ptr
 * same as shared_ptr but ref count is not maintained (Actually weak ref count is maintained)
 * special case for use in conjuction with shared_ptr
 * use when you want to observe or read an object but do not require it to remain alive
 * use to break cyclic dependency references between shared_ptr
 *
 * weak_ptr<int> wk1;
 * {
 *      shared_ptr<int> sp1 = make_shared<int>(25); // 1 strong ref created
 *      wk1 = sp1;                                  // wp1 have 1 strong, 1 weak ref
 * } // sp1 got destroyed, but wp1 is still there with 1 weak ref
 * // weak ptr wont keep object alive but shared_ptr will
