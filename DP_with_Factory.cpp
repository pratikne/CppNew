// C++ program to demonstrate factory method design pattern
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-set-2-factory-method/


/**The factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. In the Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create a new type of object. 
*  In the below example, we have totally decoupled the selection of types for object creation from the Client. The library is now responsible to decide which object type to create based on an input. The client just needs to make calls to the library’s factory Create method and pass the type it wants without worrying about the actual implementation of the creation of objects.

Other examples of the Factory Method: 

Say, in a ‘Drawing’ system, depending on the user’s input, different pictures like squares, rectangles, the circle can be drawn. Here we can use the factory method to create instances depending on the user’s input. For adding a new type of shape, no need to change the client’s code.

Another example: On the travel site, we can book train tickets as well as bus tickets and flight tickets. In this case, the user can give his travel type as ‘bus’, ‘train’, or ‘flight’. 
Here we have an abstract class ‘AnyTravel’ with a static member function ‘GetObject’ which depending on the user’s travel type, will create & return an object of ‘BusTravel’ or ‘ TrainTravel’. ‘BusTravel’ or ‘ TrainTravel’ have common functions like passenger name, Origin, and destination parameters.
