 Suppose a developer wants to create a simple DBConnection class to connect 
 to a database and wants to access the database at multiple locations from code,
 generally what the developer will do is create an instance of DBConnection class 
 and use it for doing database operations wherever required. 
 This results in creating multiple connections from the database as each instance 
 of DBConnection class will have a separate connection to the database. 
 In order to deal with it, we create DBConnection class as a singleton class, 
 so that only one instance of DBConnection is created and a single connection is established. 
 Because we can manage DB Connection via one instance, we can control load balance, 
 unnecessary connections, etc.Â **/
