/**Behavioral design pattern
 * 
 * The Abstract Class defines a template method that contains a skeleton of some
 * algorithm, composed of calls to (usually) abstract primitive operations.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses should implement these operations, but leave the template
 * method itself intact.
 * 
Standardize the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class "template method"
Steps requiring peculiar implementations are "placeholders" in base class
Derived classes implement placeholder methods

/**The template pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation deferring some steps to sub-classes. The template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure. For example, in your project, you want the behavior of the module to be able to extend, such that we can make the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications. However, no one is allowed to make source code changes to it, i.e you can add but canâ€™t modify the structure in those scenarios a developer can approach template design pattern.*/
